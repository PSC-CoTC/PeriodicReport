# PeriodicReport
Auto Production of Periodic Report, including Tables and Figures

Current Questions (please add to this list!)

CoTC:
How does the documents structure look to the committee?  Any suggestions for change?
How do the tables and figures look in general?  Anything else the CoTC would like to see (or not see)
e.g., do we wish to impose "over harvested" or "under harvested" ERs on the pre- and post-season MU status figures?
What years should we focus on for providing summary information?  Should some information be broken up by base period vs abundance-based management period?  Just recent years?  We are summarizing the following:
Hatchery releases
tagging
wild smolt estimates
fishery exploitation and escapement
would like input on how best to summarize fishery impacts
forecasts and forecast performance
survival rates of wild stocks that were tagged or MUs?
Where is the definitive MU breakpoints and associated ER caps located?  
Why do the forecasts differ between the WDFW released wild coho forecasts and what is described in the PFMC documents?
Is there a document or database that contains estimated survival rates for wild stocks in WA? (Mara provided these data in the last report)?
Anyone know where the HGMPs currently reside on the internet? And, if they don't, who to ask for copies of them?
How to move forward with further input and review from CoTC members?

CoTC & CoWG:
What are the most important pieces of information that we have available to summarize that are helpful for the 2029 negotiations?
