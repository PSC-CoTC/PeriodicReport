Auto Production of Periodic Report, including Tables and Figures

Current Questions (please add to this list!)

CoTC:
How does the documents structure look to the committee?  Any suggestions for change?  I was told in Jan 2024 that we will receive this input from the SP after providing them a first draft.  Gary asked for summaries of MM fish intercepted by each party and the ERs of the MUs associated with MSFs vs NSFs

How do the tables and figures look in general?  Anything else the CoTC would like to see (or not see)
e.g., do we wish to impose "over harvested" or "under harvested" ERs on the pre- and post-season MU status figures?  Jan 2024 - Yes, the CoTC would like to see a summary of Post season ERs compared to post-season allowable ERs and possibly a summary of MUs not meeting their escapement over time....

What years should we focus on for providing summary information?  Should some information be broken up by base period vs abundance-based management period?  Just recent years? Jan 2024 The years we are focused on in particular are catch years 2010 to present.

We are summarizing the following:
Hatchery releases
tagging
wild smolt estimates
fishery exploitation and escapement
would like input on how best to summarize fishery impacts
forecasts and forecast performance
survival rates of wild stocks that were tagged or MUs?

Where is the definitive MU breakpoints and associated ER caps located?  Diego said to use the PFMC documents!

Why do the forecasts differ between the WDFW released wild coho forecasts and what is described in the PFMC documents?  Jan 2024 - Marissa said that the forecasts are agreed to numbers and often differ from the WDFW numbers published!

Is there a document or database that contains estimated survival rates for wild stocks in WA? (Mara provided these data in the last report)?  Marissa provided these to me in Jan 2024 and they are now in the static table file

Anyone know where the HGMPs currently reside on the internet? And, if they don't, who to ask for copies of them?  Still don't know

How to move forward with further input and review from CoTC members?  They are awaiting the ability to review :)

CoTC & CoWG:
What are the most important pieces of information that we have available to summarize that are helpful for the 2029 negotiations?  TBD
